### About

A simple experiment to know whether 2 Go programs will conflict or share the same environment variable value if the environment key used in both program is same.

Both apps ran on same machine/host using bash starter script strategy.

### Result

They are NOT sharing the same environment variable value even the environment key used is same. :tada:
